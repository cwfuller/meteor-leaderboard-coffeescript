# Meteor - Leaderboard, coffeescript version

This is my conversion of the Leaderboard example to coffeescript. I also added the suggested expansions to the app.

## Installation notes

Since the git repo doesn't include the .meteor folder, I imagine you need to run <code>meteor add coffeescript</code> manually to get this to work.
